Prerequisites:**\n\n*   Make sure you have a `llama.cpp` server running and accessible. By default, the script assumes it\u0027s at `http://localhost:10000`.\n    ```bash\n    # Example command to start llama.cpp server\n    ./server -m models/7B/ggml-model.bin -c 2048\n    ```\n\n**2. Save the Script:**\n\n*   Save the code above into a file named `proxy_server.py`.\n\n**3. Install Dependencies:**\n\n*   You\u0027ll need `Flask`, `Flask-CORS`, and `requests`. You can install them with pip:\n    ```bash\n    pip install Flask Flask-CORS requests\n    ```\n\n**4. Run the Proxy Server:**\n\n*   Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run:\n    ```bash\n    python proxy_server.py\n    ```\n*   You should see the following output, confirming the server is running:\n    ```\n    🦙 Llama in the Middle Proxy starting...\n    Forwarding requests from http://0.0.0.0:11111 to http://localhost:10000\n     * Serving Flask app \u0027proxy_server\u0027\n     * Debug mode: off\n     * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)\n     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:11111\n     * Running on http://[your-local-ip]:11111\n    Press CTRL+C to quit\n    ```\n\n### How to Test It\n\nNow, you can send your requests to the proxy on port `11111` instead of directly to the `llama.cpp` server on port `10000`.\n\nOpen a **new terminal** and run the `curl` command you provided.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:11111/completion --data \u0027{\"prompt\":\"Yo, give me some simple emoji\", \"stream\": true}\u0027\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\nYou will see the streaming JSON response from the `llama.cpp` server, passed through your proxy, chunk by chunk. It will look something like this:\n\n```json\ndata: {\"content\":\"\n\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\"Sure\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\",\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\" here\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\" are\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\" some\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\" simple\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\" em\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\"ojis\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\":\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\"\\n\\n\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\"😀\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\"👍\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\"❤️\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\"🎉\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"content\":\"🚀\",\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":false,\"multimodal\":false}\ndata: {\"completion_probabilities\":null,\"timings\":{\"prompt_n\":12,\"prompt_ms\":31.109,\"prompt_per_token_ms\":2.592,\"prompt_per_second\":385.738,\"predicted_n\":23,\"predicted_ms\":113.844,\"predicted_per_token_ms\":4.95,\"predicted_per_second\":202.013},\"slot_id\":0,\"stop\":true,\"stopped_eos\":true,\"stopped_limit\":false,\"stopped_word\":false,\"model\":\"/path/to/your/model.gguf\",\"generation_settings\":...}\n```\n\nThis simple script is now a solid foundation.

All other requests (like `/tokenize`, `GET` requests, etc.) fall through to the original generic proxy logic.\n\n2.  **`generate_chained_completion` Generator**:\n    *   This function is the core of the new logic. It\u0027s a Python [generator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators), which means it can `yield` values one by one without exiting. Flask uses this to build streaming responses.\n    *   It initializes the `full_prompt` with the user\u0027s original prompt.\n    *   It enters a `while` loop that continues until the desired number of total tokens (`n_predict_total`) has been generated, or the model signals that it\u0027s finished.\n\n3.  **The Loop**:\n    *   **Payload Construction**: In each iteration, it creates a new JSON payload to send to the `llama.cpp` backend. Crucially, `payload[\"prompt\"]` is set to the `full_prompt`, which includes all the text generated in previous steps.\n    *   **Request Backend**: It makes a `POST` request to `http://localhost:10000/completion` asking for a small number of tokens (`GENERATION_CHUNK_SIZE`).\n    *   **Stream Forwarding**: As it receives streaming lines (`data: ...`) from the backend, it **immediately `yield`s them to the client**. This is the magic trick. The client sees a continuous flow of tokens, unaware that the proxy is making multiple separate calls in the background.\n    *   **State Update**: While forwarding the data, it also parses it to update its own state. It appends the newly generated text (`content`) to `full_prompt` and checks for the `stop: true` signal from the model.\n\n4.  **Client Experience**: The client connects to `http://localhost:11111/completion` with `stream: true`. It receives a standard EventSource stream and sees tokens appearing one by one, exactly as if it were connected directly to a model generating the full 50 tokens in one go.\n\n### How to Run and Test\n\nThe setup is the same as before.\n\n1.  Save the code as `proxy_server_v2.py`.\n2.  Make sure `Flask`, `Flask-CORS`, and `requests` are installed.\n3.  Run the `llama.cpp` server on port `10000`.\n4.  Run the proxy server: `python proxy_server_v2.py`.\n\n**Test Command:**\n\nUse the same `curl` command. The proxy will now handle the `n_predict` parameter (or its default of 50).\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:11111/completion --data \u0027{\"prompt\":\"Once upon a time in a land far, far away\", \"stream\": true, \"n_predict\": 40}\u0027\n```\n\nWhen you run this, watch the **terminal where your proxy is running**. You will see log messages showing it making multiple small requests to the backend, creating the illusion of a single, long generation for the client.",

This specifically checks if the client sent the \"infinite\" flag.\n3.  **Override**: If the value is `-1`, we print a log message explaining what the proxy is doing and set our internal `n_predict_total` variable to `DEFAULT_N_PREDICT` (which is 50).\n4.  **Use Positive Value**: If the value is any other number (e.g., `40`, `100`), we use it directly.\n5.  **Safe Loop**: The `while` loop condition `while total_tokens_generated \u003c n_predict_total` is now always safe, as `n_predict_total` is guaranteed to be a positive integer, correctly representing the *proxy\u0027s* generation goal.\n\n### Full Updated Script (`proxy_server_v3.py`)\n\nFor completeness, here is the full script with the fix integrated.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom flask import Flask, request, Response, stream_with_context\nfrom flask_cors import CORS\n\n# --- Configuration ---\nLLAMA_CPP_URL \u003d \"http://localhost:10000\"\nPROXY_HOST \u003d \"0.0.0.0\"\nPROXY_PORT \u003d 11111\n\n# --- Configuration for Chained Completion ---\nDEFAULT_N_PREDICT \u003d 50\nGENERATION_CHUNK_SIZE \u003d 5\n\n# --- Flask App Initialization ---\napp \u003d Flask(__name__)\nCORS(app)\n\ndef generate_chained_completion(original_request_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    This generator function handles the chained completion logic.\n    It makes multiple small requests to the backend and yields the\n    results as a single, continuous stream.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

      "text": "**Examining the Core Issue**\n\nI\u0027ve been analyzing the user\u0027s report, and I see the root of the problem lies in `llama.cpp`\u0027s handling of `n_predict`. It prematurely sets `\"stop\": true`, which causes issues when expecting it to continue generating. This seems like a critical point to address in resolving the reported behavior.\n\n\n**Refining the Logic**\n\nI\u0027m now diving deeper into the nuances of stopping conditions. I\u0027ve realized we need a more robust way to distinguish between a natural stop and an artificial one triggered by `n_predict`. To achieve this, I\u0027m considering using a list of common end-of-sentence markers. If we encounter a stop signal but the generated text ends with one of these markers, it indicates a natural completion, and we can signal to continue as expected. This will refine our proxy\u0027s ability to interpret stops accurately.\n\n\n**Constructing a Solution**\n\nI\u0027m solidifying the implementation strategy now. The core is the conditional logic to differentiate natural stops from artificial ones. I\u0027m focusing on the `END_TOKENS` list and where it best fits in the architecture. Ensuring we accurately track tokens generated per chunk is crucial for determining artificial stops. I\u0027ll need to count the received content chunks as a proxy. Also, I\u0027m considering edge cases and error handling to ensure robustness.\n\n\n**Developing the Stop Condition**\n\nI\u0027m making progress on the implementation. The key is in accurately interpreting the \"stop\" signal. I\u0027m focusing on incorporating the `END_TOKENS` check within the `generate_chained_completion` function. To determine if a stop is artificial, I\u0027ll count the content chunks and compare that to the requested generation size. I\u0027m also planning to increment `content_chunks_received` and handle edge cases gracefully, such as empty responses, to make the proxy more robust.\n\n\n**Addressing Stop Condition Refinement**\n\nI\u0027m now implementing the stop condition check within the code. I\u0027m focusing on the `generate_chained_completion` function and integrating the `END_TOKENS` check to differentiate natural from artificial stops. To achieve this, I\u0027m incrementing `content_chunks_received` and incorporating checks for the `n_predict` condition, which helps determine if the model stopped naturally or was forced. This will increase robustness, so it handles these stops accurately.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Strategy**\n\nI\u0027ve got the pieces in place now. The core logic is defined, the edge cases are considered, and the main workflow is clear. I will begin coding the changes directly into the proxy. First, I\u0027ll integrate the `END_TOKENS` check and the token counting into `generate_chained_completion`. Then, I\u0027ll ensure any changes in behavior are tested rigorously, and make sure that any error handling is as robust as possible.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Check**\n\nI\u0027m now fully ready to implement the fix. The logic is clear and well-defined, and the necessary variables are identified. I will integrate the `END_TOKENS` check inside `generate_chained_completion`. I\u0027ll focus on testing edge cases to ensure the logic works as expected in all scenarios. I\u0027ll make sure to increment `content_chunks_received` and handle situations where `n_predict` is fulfilled or the model stops naturally.\n\n\n**Analyzing Stop Conditions**\n\nI\u0027m now refining the logic to determine a \"natural\" stop versus an artificial one. I\u0027ll utilize a list of common end-of-sentence tokens, like periods and newlines. The count of received chunks will help indicate whether the generated text meets the requested size, or the model ended prematurely.\n\n\n\n**Improving Stop Detection**\n\nI\u0027m now considering the best method to differentiate natural stops from forced ones. It involves evaluating received text for end-of-sentence markers. I\u0027ll need to count the content chunks to check if the desired size was met. This will help refine the logic to handle artificial stops.\n\n\n**Developing Stop-Signal Logic**\n\nI\u0027m now implementing the stop condition check based on the recent analysis. The central focus is accurately differentiating between natural and artificial stops. The `content_chunks_received` variable is key for the differentiation. I\u0027ll need to use the `END_TOKENS` list to decide.\n\n\n\n",

This is our heuristic for a \"natural\" stop.\n\n2.  **`content_chunks_in_batch` counter**: Inside the `while` loop, we now count how many `content` chunks we receive from the backend for each small request. Since `llama.cpp`\u0027s server typically sends one `content` object per token, this is a good proxy for the number of tokens generated in that batch.\n\n3.  **The Decision Block**: The core change is in the `if last_chunk_data and last_chunk_data.get(\u0027stop\u0027):` block.\n    *   **Case 1 (Natural Stop by Length):** We check if `content_chunks_in_batch \u003c tokens_to_request`. If the model generated *fewer* tokens than the 5 we asked for, it must have hit an internal stop condition (like its own EOS token). We can confidently say this is a `model_stopped_naturally` and break our main loop.\n    *   **Case 2 (Potential Artificial Stop):** If the model generated exactly the 5 tokens we asked for, it\u0027s ambiguous. We then check if the text it just generated (`chunk_generated_text`) ends with one of our `END_TOKENS`.\n        *   If it **does**, we treat it as a natural stop. For example, if the 5th token was a period `.`\n        *   If it **does not**, we assume it was an **artificial stop**. We print a message confirming this and simply let the `while` loop continue to the next iteration to ask for more tokens. The `model_stopped_naturally` flag remains `False`.\n\nThis new version is significantly more robust and correctly handles the chained generation, allowing the proxy to build up a long response from multiple short requests until the model truly finishes or the total token limit is reached.",

This is now the source of truth for our available models.\n\n2.  **`request_batch_index`**: A new counter, `request_batch_index`, is initialized to `0` before the `while` loop. This counter tracks how many requests we have made to the backend *within a single client completion request*.\n\n3.  **Round-Robin Logic**: Inside the loop, this is the new core logic:\n    ```python\n    # Pick the next server from the list, cycling back to the start if needed.\n    backend_index \u003d request_batch_index % len(BACKEND_SERVERS)\n    current_backend_url \u003d BACKEND_SERVERS[backend_index]\n    target_url \u003d f\"{current_backend_url}/completion\"\n    ```\n    *   The modulo operator (`%`) is perfect for this. `0 % 2` is `0`, `1 % 2` is `1`, `2 % 2` is `0`, and so on. This elegantly cycles through the indices of our `BACKEND_SERVERS` list.\n    *   The `target_url` for the `requests.post` call is now constructed dynamically in each iteration.\n\n4.  **Incrementing the Counter**: At the end of the `while` loop, we do `request_batch_index +\u003d 1` to ensure the next iteration queries the next server in the list.\n\n5.  **Logging**: The log messages have been updated to show which backend server is being queried for each batch, making it easy to see the blending in action.\n\n### How to Run and Test\n\nThis setup is more complex as it requires multiple backend servers.\n\n1.  **Start Two `llama.cpp` Servers**: Open two separate terminals. You can use the same model or different ones to see truly interesting blended results.\n    *   **Terminal 1:**\n        ```bash\n        ./server -m models/your-model-A.gguf --port 10000\n        ```\n    *   **Terminal 2:**\n        ```bash\n        ./server -m models/your-model-B.gguf --port 10001\n        ```\n    *   *Note: If you only have one model, just run the same command twice with different ports.*\n\n2.  **Run the Proxy Server**: In a third terminal, run our new Python script.\n    ```bash\n    python proxy_server_v5.py\n    ```\n    You should see the startup message confirming it knows about both backend servers.\n\n3.  **Test with `curl`**: In a fourth terminal, send a request to the proxy.\n    ```bash\n    curl -X POST http://localhost:11111/completion --data \u0027{\"prompt\":\"The first rule of Fight Club is\", \"stream\": true, \"n_predict\": 40}\u0027\n    ```\n\n**Observe the proxy\u0027s terminal output!** You will now see the magic happen. The logs will look something like this:\n\n```\n--- Blended Completion Started ---\n...\n\u003e [Batch 0] Routing to http://localhost:10000 for 5 tokens...\n\u003c Received from http://localhost:10000: \u0027 you do not talk\u0027\nArtificial stop detected (limit reached).

This is the foundation of powerful model orchestration.",
